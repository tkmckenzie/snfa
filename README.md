Fitting of non-parametric production frontiers for use in efficiency analysis. Methods are provided for both a smooth analogue of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a non-parametric analogue of Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Frontiers are constructed for multiple inputs and a single output using constrained kernel smoothing as in Racine et al. (2009), which allow for the imposition of monotonicity and concavity constraints on the estimated frontier.
